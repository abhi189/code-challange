# Centene Angular Project

Angular project, built under a clean architecture that helps to scale and maintain a fast workflow.

# BONUS QUESTION

The answer to the bonus question is that user 'Rand Miller' UUID in enrollees.ts is of different type so the UUID validation which is done in enrolleeService.ts on line 65 is causing 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR'. If we can assign correct UUID to user RAND MILLER - the issue will be resolved.
